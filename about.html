                    <h1> Ok, but Seriously<br> Who are you?</h1>

                    <p>
                        Haven't you took a look at the Home Page? I am the World's BEST Engineer! </p>

                    <p>Alright, jokes aside, I am an Mechanical Engineering student attending California Univeristy, Fresno.
                        I have 2 more semesters left before graduation. At first I wanted to become an Airline pilot, but then the flight school are too expensive. So I decided to become
                        an Engieer. I wanted to better understand things around me. I love to solve problems and try new things. I like to be creative and solve problems in different ways.
                        I don't believe there is only one right answer; I think there are much more to problem solving than getting the right answer. The process and journey of getting there
                        is what the most rewarding to me. Because I get to meet many different people and enhance my knowledge with their guidance. This long journey to getting my Engineering Degree
                        taught me how to be patient and it builds my perseverance. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Althought I am a Mechanical Engineering Major, but I'm also doing some Civil Engineering projects/research on the side. Those CE projects aren't 
                        required by the school, they are only my own interest. I am facinated with bridges and skyscrapers. The Civil Engineers made many world wonders possible. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the right is part of the flight procedures I've made solely for A320-NEO in Flight Sim. They are ONLY useful for practice flying on the Flight Sim, not flying in the real world. 
                        I am NOT responsible for any consequences when following my procedures whlie real world flying. With that being said, you can connect with me on Linkedin. Or you can
                        keep exploring my webpage.
