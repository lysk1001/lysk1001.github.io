                            Only to find out that only College sells them. So I went to the nearest College and started to order my Engineering meal. The staffs there told me I have to

                        He came from a hoarder's house and was turned over to the shelter by the owner.
                        Birch likes to chase laser and run around in the house. However, he doesn't produce milk for some reason.
