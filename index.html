                        <h3> Engineering </h3>
                        <p>
                            Engineering is not just about problem solving. It's also about solving problems efficiently. As an Engineering student,
                            I've learned that it's best not to re-invent the wheels if I don't have to. In order to save time and resources, it would be
                            best to tweak, or improve the pre-existing model to fit my need. Innovation is also a form of tweaking nature's existing model
                            to fit our need. For example, airplanes are pre-existing models of birds; ships are pre-existing models of fishes. One way or 
                            another, Engineering is about solving problems in efficient way that benefit our lifes and those around us.

                        This was my 3rd PC I've built so far. It was by far the most expensive PC I've ever build. Total over $3,500.
                        This was also a good way challenge myself not to make any mistakes while working on an expensive project. Building a PC
                        is also an art itself. I was gentle and precise, in the placement of the CPU and the wire management. This beast is eqiuped
                        with RTX 3090 Graphic card and AMD Razen 5950x CPU.

                        made by Airbus and Boeing. I also know how to spot their differences, interior and exterior. Boeing and Airbus are both the largest

            <h1>Most Used Softwares</h1>
            <p> 
                Besides Microsoft Offices, here are some softwares that I use the most. <br>
                I've rank them based on my proficiency.

                            I am good at SolidWorks. This software itself is very intuitive. I mostly use this to draw sketches of 
                            linkages in my Design of Machinery course. I've also used SolidWorks to do load analysis on a cranehook. 
                            I would say, with practice, I will be able to master SolidWorks for my future job employment.

                         At first MATLAB wasn't too useful, as many of my math classes doesn't really emphasize on using this software. But 
                          as I continued further into my Engineering courses, this became one of my "go to" tool. It helped me in many different ways, from 
                            graphing to solving solutions for differential equations. I am decent at MATLAB; I could use it to finish most of my 
                            Engineering homework and projects.

                            Most of the time I use Mircrosoft Word to write my reports. But when it comes to Resume design, I use LaTeX. There are many
                            functions and freedom that LaTex have over MS Word. For example, the math symbols and complex equations that I could write with
                            LaTex I couldn't otherwise in MS Word. I am good with LaTeX and I use it to make documents that wouldn't have been easy to make 
                            with MS Word.
