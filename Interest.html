                        Watch youtube videos about funny memes, as well as Engineering 
                        related topics. Gaming videos and current events.

                        <p>I used to be a World of Warcraft raid leader. But now I like to play Sterllaris, Factorio, GTA V, and City Skyline. In fact, I am using City Skyline to do my Transportation Planning research project.
                            There are other Civil Engineers also using City Skyline as a tool to help people undertand city zoning and city development management.

                These includes, but not limited to personal projects.</p>

                    <h3>Boeing 747 Modeling</h3>
                    <p>I made this Boeing 747 model as a side project. 
                        I used SolidWorks and followed some Youtube videos
                        on how to create "Lofts". I thought it would be fun to
                        try it out on my own.</p>

                    <h3>Stop Motion Animation</h3>
                    <p>I made this stop motion animation with 12 frames
                        per second as the speed. This mini clip is a part of a larger clips. 
                        The thing about stop motion animation is that, for every frame that's 
                        basically a picture. So I took about 48 pictures to made this 4 second clip. 
                        The camera was static for the entire time.

                    <p>
                        Remember the previous Alien Tech over at the HOME PAGE? Ok, that was the most expensive PC I've ever built.
                        And as for this one, this one has a RTX 3060 graphic card and it's fan cooled. The other one I've build have 
                        RTX 3090 graphic card, and that was liquid cooled. Honestly, the temperature difference wasn't even that 
                        significant. I hypothesize that, the PC temperature is more dependent on your ambient temperature than the 
                        installed cooler.

                        Yup, another simulation type of game. This is Kerbal Space Program,
                        everything you need to know about rocket science in your back yard.
                        I launched many rockets in order to build this mini space station. From
                        buliding stage rockets to rendezvous docking. First I tried to do it 
                        manually, but then I realized I can use 'computerized' mod to do it 
                        accurately. Don't feel bad, NASA uses 'computerized' mod to fly their 
                        things too.

                        A320-NEO. Flying this thing on a keyboard and mouse is impossible. So I have a Xbox Controller next to my
                        captain seat. It's honestly not hard to learn flying an airplane on a Simulator. Most of the "hard" things are like memorize 
                        flight check lists and flight procedures. I flew from LAX to SFO, full flight no problem.

                    <p>At last, I was able to make this website using a couple hundred lines of HTML and CSS.
                        I've made this website from the ground up, code by code, with the guidance of some Youtube videos and Googling. 
                        Having taken some computer science classes in the past (learned some HTML and CSS in highschool) gave me confidents in what I was doing. The code
                        didn't seem too foreign after all. This site should be fully responsive on mobile devices.
