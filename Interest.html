                Whether I am in the classroom or outside of the classroom, <br>
                I am always learning, and trying something new

                    <h3> Hobby </h3>
                    <p>I like to review my previous math and Engineering classes.
                        Watch youtube videos about funny memes, as well as Engineering 
                        related topics. Gaming videos and current events.

                        <p>Marvel is cool. I like The Travlers on Netflix and BREAKING BAD!!!
                            Catch Me If You Can, The Wolf of WallStreet, LOTR, The Hobbit, The Mandalorian, and Star Wars of course!

                        <p>I used to be a World of Warcraft raid leader. But now I like to play Sterllaris, Factorio, GTA V, and City Skyline. In fact, I am using City Skyline to do my Transportation Planning research project.
                            There are other Civil Engineers also using City Skyline as a tool to help people undertand city zoning and city development management.

                    <h3>Boeing 747 Modeling</h3>
                    <p>I made this Boeing 747 model as a side project. 
                        I used SolidWorks and followed some Youtube videos
                        on how to create "Lofts". I thought it would be fun to
                        try it out.</p>

                    <h3>Stop Motion Animation</h3>
                    <p>I made this stop motion animation with the speed of 12 frames per second. This mini clip is a part of a larger clips. 
                        The thing about stop motion animation is that, for every frame that's 
                        basically a picture. So I took about 48 pictures to made this 4 second clip. 
                        The camera was static for the entire time.

                    <h3> My 4th PC build</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was the 4th PC I've built so far. It has a RTX 3060 TI graphics card and the CPU cooler is fan cooled. The other one I've build has 
                        a RTX 3090 graphics card, and that was liquid cooled. Honestly, the temperature difference wasn't even that 
                        significant. I hypothesize that, the PC temperature is more dependent on the ambient temperature than the 
                        installed cooler. This PC is equiped with 1TB SSD. I always tried to keep a tidy cable 
                        management.

                    <h3>Kerbal Space Program</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yup, another simulation type of game. This is Kerbal Space Program,
                        everything you need to know about rocket science in your back yard.
                        I launched many rockets in order to build this mini space station. From
                        buliding stage rockets to rendezvous docking. First I tried to do it 
                        manually, but then I realized I can use 'computerized' mod to do it 
                        accurately. Don't feel bad, NASA uses 'computerized' mod to fly their 
                        things too.

                    <p>
                        A320-NEO. Flying this thing on a keyboard and mouse is impossible. So I have a custom made yoke stick. It's honestly not hard to learn flying an airplane on a Simulator. Most of the "hard" things are like memorize 
                        flight check lists and flight procedures. I enjoy flying on the Flight Simulator, the freedom of roaming around the planet is nice!

                    <h3>Making my own website</h3>
                    <p>At last, I was able to make this website using HTML and CSS.
                        I've made this website from the ground up, code by code. 
                        Having taken some computer science classes in the past (learned some HTML and CSS in highschool) gave me confidence in what I was doing. The code
                        didn't seem too foreign after all. This site should be fully responsive on mobile devices.
